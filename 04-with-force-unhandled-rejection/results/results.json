But please note that our estimates are now based on an average completion rate, and there are some professional developers who go through our basic programming tracks with ease. This means that you may need more time if you are new to programming and just getting started. We’re working on making these estimates more accurate and personalized..

If you need to detect that CMake command on your project was run from CLion (and if so, set special variables/paths or execute some additional scripts of your choice) use CLION_IDE environment variable. To make it easier to find it CLion provides you with the environment variables completion.. Add/delete files. When adding a new file, CLion suggests to add it to the CMake target.. When deleting files from the project, CLion removes the file reference from the command arguments, or warns you about a possibly incorrect command after deletion.. Import Project. You can also import non-CMake projects (File | Import Project...), for which CLion will generate a CMakeLists.txt file.. CMake generators. Support for the CMake File API lets CLion enable various CMake generators. Users can select Ninja, Xcode, Visual Studio, etc. This works for all platforms, in remote mode, and with WSL.. CMake configuration. CMake Profiles. With CMake profiles (Build, Execution, Deployment | CMake) you have control over CMake generation directory, CMake configuration types, CMake options and environment variables, etc.. Create any necessary number of CMake profiles from scratch, or copy existing ones (with all the settings pre-filled). In case you have custom build types created by the setting CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES, they will appear in the Build type drop-down as well.. Switch between CMake profiles in the run configuration switcher on the toolbar or in the Run (^⌥R)/Debug (^⌥D) configuration switcher popup.. CMake tool window and CMake Cache. CMake tool window includes the CMake output logs, that can be used to track the progress and debug CMake scripts.. It also allows to open a CMakeCache.txt file right in the editor for further editing, like for example adding new variable to it.. CMake menu. Go to Tools | CMake for useful CMake-related actions:. Smart CMake support. Rename in CMake. If you use Rename refactoring ⇧F6 to rename user symbols in CMake (like functions or macros), all the usages will be updated automatically.. CMake Install. If you have any CMake install targets in your project, you can call Install from the CLion’s Run menu now. The cmake install command will be executed. Alternatively, you can add an Install step to any of your run configurations in CLion.. CMake Comments. CLion supports CMake 3 bracket-arguments and block comments syntax. To quickly comment a line in CMake, you don’t need to select it — simply put the caret on it and press ⌘/ . To comment a block, select it and press ⌥⌘/.. CMake completion. While editing CMake files in CLion, you can use auto-completion for CMake commands and variables (only for variables with static names). Auto-completion for CMake variables works in set/unset commands or after ${ and supports both Middle matching and Snake matching, as usual.. Code generation in CMake. Create frequently-used or custom code constructs in CMake and reuse them with live templates. Select between predefined templates or create your own.. To use the template, type its abbreviation (you can use auto-completion here as well) and then press Tab (or any non-default key you’ve configured) to expand the template.. After you finish editing, a banner shows up where you can choose to reload the current project manually, or enable automatic reload on every edit.. Products. Solutions. Initiatives. Community.

If you look in the right-hand editor gutter, you will see yellow and red error strips that, if clicked, navigate you to the detected issues. Another way to navigate from one highlighted issue to another is by pressing F2/⇧F2. The status indicator at the top of the gutter summarizes the file status.. In addition to finding compilation errors, CLion identifies code inefficiencies and even performs data flow analysis over your code to locate unreachable/unused code, as well as other issues and 'code smells'.. Quick-fixes. CLion’s on-the-fly code inspections cover about 40 potential problem cases in C/C++ code and quite a few for other languages as well.. When a problem is highlighted, place the caret on it, press ⌥Enter and choose from the suggested quick-fix solutions. (Alternatively, enter the context menu by clicking the light bulb next to the line.). You can also choose to fix all similar issues across your project. Or, if you don’t find this inspection useful, you can suppress it for the desired scope.. Inspect code. CLion provides detailed descriptions for all of the available inspections. You can also manage their severity (choose from Typo, Warning, Error, etc.) or even in some cases adjust an inspection’s parameters to better reflect your requirements.. You can run multiple inspections (or even all of them) in this batch mode with Code | Inspect Code.. If you’d like to eliminate a particular problem from your entire code base, you can use Run inspection by name (⌥⇧⌘I) and select the desired scope. A separate window with inspection results will open in which you can regroup issues and batch-apply quick-fixes to all the issues, where possible.. Clang-Tidy. CLion comes with the Clang-Tidy integration. Clang-Tidy checks are shown the same way as CLion’s own built-in code inspections, and quick-fixes are also available via ⌥Enter.. Go to Settings/Preferences | Editor | Inspections | C/C++ | General | Clang-Tidy to tune the list of checks enabled/disabled in CLion. Clang-Tidy command line format is used in the text field. The default configuration can be found here. Or use .clang-tidy config files instead of the IDE-provided settings.. Enable C++ Core Guidelines or Clang Static Analyzer checks, try Modernize checks or even implement your own checks and get them immediately in CLion (for custom checks, change the Clang-Tidy binary to your own one under Settings/Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | C/C++).. Checks on top of Clangd. There are several inspections implemented on top of the custom Clangd-based engine in CLion:. The ‘unused includes’ check suggests 3 detection strategies: a conservative one, an aggressive one, and the default one (Detect not directly used) which is the closest to the “Include What You Use” principle.. Learn more. Data Flow Analysis. Data flow analysis (DFA) tracks the flow of data in your code and detects potential issues based on that analysis. In addition to the local DFA (which works within a single function), CLion includes global DFA (which takes a whole translation unit of a program as a single unit for analysis). Global DFA not only enriches the already existing checks but also adds several unique inspections.. MISRA. CLion comes with checks from MISRA C 2012 and MISRA C++ 2008.

    "content": "Abstract:. Can you make me productive with a C++ IDE? Anastasia Kazakova, Product Marketing Manager for CLion. CLion from JetBrains is a powerful integrated development environment built to help productivity across all aspects of C++ code. In this talk, the different aspects of how users can maximize their productivity and the features built into CLion are examined in a live demo scenario. Examples of code generation which can generate constructors, getters and setters, equality operators, relational operators, stream output operators, and override functions are explained with real-world scenarios which generate half of your daily quota for lines of code in minutes.. Anastasia explains the process of productive documentation writing using CLion’s built-in Doxygen style which makes it simple to maintain code and actually see and generate documentation. The quick documentation function is much more than this, with features such as macro replacement which can be run over huge code hierarchies: a feature the Boost.Hana author, Louis Dionne, has since learned about after having previously debugging this macro by hand, by copying the output of the preprocessor and looking at it.. Code analysis and debugging is also a very important, time-consuming aspect of working with C++ code. CLion’s capabilities are covered with examples of the static analysis options, data flow analysis, and the remote debugging tools. Integration with Clang, CMake, Valgrind, and the new compilation database are available and their uses are detailed. Not to mention profiling your code with Dtrace for Mac users and Perf for Linux, which you can do with the IDE and then follow problems, go straight to your code and fix them.. Unit tests are also covered and there is integration with Google Test, Boost.Test, and Catch to help you effectively test your code. There are features included such as “rerun all the tests that actually failed” where you can rerun all the tests that failed without having to select them manually, which can save a lot of time.. This live demo goes through the features which will have the quickest impact on your making productive changes to the way you can code with live examples of how they work in practice and their effects on the code.. Transcript:. Speaker Make me productive with C++ IDE. Now, I have my guess as to what the answer's going to be, but let's wait and see. Anastasia.. Anastasia K Yeah, thank you. There will be a live demo, so I do encourage everyone to come closer. You will be able to see better if you come closer. We have some spare tables here at the front. It is a live demo, what could possibly go wrong? Nearly everything. So it should be good to close our event with.. I hope you had a nice dinner, got to grab a glass of wine, or a beer, or something. So you should be in a good mood now to look at your C++ IDE. So let's start. A C++ IDE is not a very easy thing to create, as you probably got from my talk at the very beginning of this event. There has been lots of effort put into CLion. There is a fun story about CLion, believe it or not, for a very long time we didn't actually believe we could make a C++ IDE at JetBrains. Then a funny thing happened, we started AppCode. A show of hands, who knows what AppCode is? So this is an IDE for iOS and Mac development. We started supporting their Objective C and their Objective C++, and suddenly, we found ourselves in a situation where we did a C++ parser. We were a little bit surprised. We actually read a nice blog post, which was saying, \"It seems you're doing a C++ parser, so we guess you are going to start doing a C++ IDE soon.\". That happened in about 2012. Then, four years ago, we actually released CLion, our cross-platform C and C++ IDE. Also, in the same year, we released ReSharper C++, an extension for Visual Studio for C++, but that's another story. I will be demoing CLion here.. The main idea behind CLion is to help you to be more productive with C++ code. And that's all we try to implement. Let's start with a very simple example. What I love about CLion and about the enhanced productivity it provides me, is when I see an IDE in front of me, I'm usually thinking, \"Come on, can you generate code for me? Can I sit here and you will write code for me?” It is not that simple, but it is still possible.. So let's generate some things. I have a few things available here in the menu. Let's start with the constructor. OK. I will select all the fields. It will generate in place so that you don't have to switch between different files to see the result. So here is my constructor. Let me close this one so you can see it better. I can generate getters and setters. I will also do this in place. And I can generate an equality operator. Why not?. There are a few options here. I will turn them on. It will search to see if maybe I have some existing operators for this class. So it searches to see if I have used it in some other place before. If I have, it will just add the missing operators for me. OK, I can be even lazier. A relational operator – we also search for existing ones to check if it actually needs to add one or if it should generate one from scratch. Can we do more? Stream output operator – I hate writing it manually, I think everyone hates it, especially if you have a long class. We can probably stop here.. Let's look at what we are left with. I have been lazy enough. All these things were generated automatically by my IDE for me. That is what I call proper productive laziness. When you just take a tool and it generates everything for you. OK, let's make life a little more complicated. Let's inherit from some class I have here. So I have this mammal class and it has a few virtual methods in it. What can we do here? We can override functions. So select them all and generate this stuff. So here is my makeSound override and useSelfEnergy override. OK, makeSound. I'm not sure that I'm writing any reasonable code here, but just to show you an example, let's do some sound variable. And see it actually fills in my class.. Let's do some creepy expression – I'm not sure what I'm writing here makes any sense, but just to show you. What I can do now is generate more code. I can surround this with whatever I want here. For example, I will surround it with an if-else clause. Sorry, put a line there and surround it quickly. And now, I can put some conditions here. I don't know if the weight is more than 100, for example. What I can do in the other clause is call some function.. Do you know what the problem is? I don't have this function. And that is one of the great things about JetBrains IDEs: when you don't have something, no worries. Just press Alt + Enter and it will create it for you. It is that easy. So just start using something and then ask the IDE, “OK, I forgot to actually put a declaration on the definition list. Help me to define this.” And again, actually, to do this you can see I just typed a few lines of code, pressed a few shortcuts, and I got this huge amount of code.. If you ever measure the results of your day by the lines of code you write, do you know what the optimal number of lines of code that you can develop or generate is per day? Some statistics say it’s around 70. So by doing this, half of them are already done. I am nearly ready to go home.. OK, let's do some creepy stuff here. I have a few other functions inherited from my mammal class. I'm actually not that good at biology and have no idea if the hierarchy's correct from a biological point of view, but let's try something interesting.. I have this makeSound function. Let's change the signature for this function, so I will say, \"Come on, you have a huge hierarchy using this function. Would you like me to update the whole hierarchy?\" I go, \"Yeah, why not? Let's do that.\" I update, I add some parameter here, some ID probably. Let's refactor that. Now, what we can see here is my makeSound in the human class. Here's my makeSound in livestock, here is my makeSound in bird, and, of course, my makeSound in the parent mammal class.. So when I agreed to update the whole hierarchy, what did CLion do for me? It actually propagated my change to the top of the tree and then back down through all the branches. So if you want to refactor something which is deep in your hierarchy, some leaf, it would be really nice and really productive if you don't have to update the whole tree by hand. It is really nice if an IDE can go through this tree on its own. And that's what we do.. OK, we are done with this nice human sample. Let's see what else we have here. What is the most important part of our code? OK, so there are different opinions. It is documentation because without the documentation no one will be able to maintain your code further, especially when you leave for vacation or leave a company.. There are different ways to document the code. But the documentation in CLion is much more powerful than just providing documentation for, say, function signatures. It actually tries to be smart. You may probably remember some samples from my first talk? So, because we build the whole Abstract Syntax Tree for the code, we can actually tell a lot of things about C++ code. Let's start with a simple one: I have the documentation command – that is Doxygen style, one of the most popular frameworks. It is a popular tool to document your code, in a popular format. So I have my Doxygen comment here as a brief description, and some parameter description. If I call the quick documentation popup, I have all this information rendered in a single window. We do not call Doxygen in the background, don't worry. We rendered this on our own, putting everything in place correctly. You can navigate these classes and links and we can go through it and see through the whole hierarchy in the quick documentation popup.. Do you like writing documentation by hand? I don't either, I prefer to generate it like this. So three slashes, press Enter, and now this top is generated. And the best thing is, I have my function signature here with some documentation, so I have some parameters. I will add a description for my parameter. Then I put a definition somewhere, for example, if it's in a different file. I decided to rename the parameter; I said, \"OK, it will be called myValue.\" The best thing is the documentation is updated automatically. So even after a year of changes, the documentation will be up to date. So I won't end up in some documentation naming parameters that are no longer in my code, for maybe more than a year.. OK, so you can actually see and generate documentation, but as I said, the quick documentation function is much more than this. And here is the interesting thing. I actually showed it in my first talk: macro replacement. Here it is. So the final replacement for my macro is shown here. I told you about the boost macro here, you remember that? Let's take some boost macro here. And here it is. It's actually much longer. Have you ever been interested in what's there behind the boost macro? Here it is. So you can actually see the final replacement.. I know one person in the C++ community who is really excited about this. Do you know what he is doing? Boost.Hana. Have you ever heard about this? Boost.Hana is a huge, heavy meta-programming library. The author, Louis Dionne, was actually debugging this macro by hand, just copying the output of the preprocessor and looking at it until he learned about our feature. He was so excited he forgot to ask me about all the other features. He just said, \"Yeah, finally.\" Because Boost.Hana macros are actually even longer than the one boost macro I just showed to you. And there are maybe 20 or 30 levels deeply nested inside.. So okay, you can see the macro replacement. And as I promised, you can see the type inferred. So if I call here the quick documentation—let’s make it smaller—you'll see the int value. You can guess if I’d call it for op1, what would I get? Long, naturally. And here, the double.. So you see, we do infer these types on the fly, because we actually build the whole Abstract Syntax Tree. We have two parsers in CLion and we build the whole Abstract Syntax Tree, so we know exactly which type we have for this variable. We know exactly what I actually call it and what is behind this macro. This actually includes all the information we take from the compilation flags and the environment variables. So we take all this into consideration when resolving the code.. Just to demonstrate the compilation flags to you, I have this nice sample. I have this code and there is a preprocessor branch, and it depends on this special flag. What is this special flag? I have two CMake list files. One defines the configuration and has this special flag on it and it’s one. The other is defined in the special flag and it's zero. What I have here is a resolved context with a flag that comes to me and takes me to these highlighted branches. Let me change it, so there is no flag.. The proper branch will be immediately highlighted. So that means that the configuration we're using to resolve this actually reflects this configuration with all the proper flags. So if, for example, you're doing some cross-platform development, cross-compilation, and you are targeting several platforms, naturally, you would expect the code to resolve to the proper platform to be able to fix it. So what do you do? You put this into separate configurations, then you just switch these configurations in resolve, and you've got a proper branch highlighted for you. And it's very easy to read for this code and to understand what actually happens for this particular target, for this particular configuration.. I come from the embedded world. I was really lacking features like this when I was a developer.. That is about it for the documentation. Let's do some interesting stuff with code analysis. At JetBrains, we love static analysis. We have people who have studied static analysis at university and who have even done their Ph.D. on static analysis. They're really cool with that. They can actually implement lots of interesting stuff.. Doing code analysis in C++ was really fun. We did a lot of things. So, first of all, we made our own analyzer, which can show you some different things, such as for the definition of the name, for example, or, a function that hides in a virtual function. Or, for example, if you're still a fan of the old-style printf, if you missed the format specifiers and in the actual string they don't match the types, we'll tell you, “Come on, it doesn't match. You will probably get some unpredictable results. Check that.”. Of course, there is also using an assignment in a condition. I think every C++ and C programmer has made this by mistake at least once in their life. Myself, I have done it more than once. So we highlight these things, saying it is probably not what you actually meant here. And a very nice thing for escaping from the local scope – a very popular error in the C++ world. So when you have a local variable and they're like, \"OK, it will return this for you using the address.\" And it's no longer valid, so that's a runtime error. You can check that, as well.. We work, as I said, with two language engines. So we have our own language engine, and we introduced a second one a year ago which works in Pearl and it's based on Clang. It's our own branch of the Clang LLVM repository that includes a bunch of different fixes on top of Clang.. What we do here is, first of all, our engine actually provides an error, such as “no matching function”. So the overload resolution failed here. But then we ask Clang for the particular reason for that, and it provides “substitution failed because no type named inner type,” and you know what I can do? I can navigate to it. So I can actually look at what is actually causing the failure or where this inner type requirement is found. Same here, it says “no member named method,” and I can navigate to this place and see where I've actually been. So here this is in just one file, but you can guess it could be in different files and you'll still navigate to the proper place.. So, as I said in my first talk, if you don't debug the overload resolution that failed, you can still actually get some additional information from your tooling. Here is a pretty exciting sample I really like. We have C-style casts, which you can actually configure in CLion and say, \"OK, come on. I am old school. I am legacy. I will use C-style casts.'' But again, I also say, “I will be more modern. I will use C++-style cast.'' What's the problem with them? It is that there is more than one. So you actually have to select which cast to use if it's a C++ cast. We actually made this task a little bit easier. So when the tab doesn't match, if you press Alt + Enter and ask to cast: here is the static_cast; dynamic_cast; reinterpret_cast; and const_cast. What we are trying to do is understand from the context which particular cast you actually need and try to add it for you. Naturally, you can't always do it, but we do our best. But in about 80% of the cases, we match the cast properly. You might be quite happy with that.. When we started doing code analysis, we found out that we have a person in the team who actually did their Ph.D. on data flow analysis. We couldn't escape that. We asked them to implement data flow analysis for C++. That's something that the compiler can do for you. And it's the thing that helps you with the runtime issues. You know what? Because it analyzes how the data flows through your code and suggests particular foreign logic issues. So for example, here it tells me the condition is always true. You can guess that there is a previous if/else clause where I'm either assigning red or it is already yellow. There is no need to check that in this case. So that's true already.. OK, another example of this kind is, here I see unreachable code. Why? Because it is the case with the color yellow. And then the previous switch case, I am actually assigning red, blue, or green. The compiler can't get it because it doesn't take the data in the same way it flows through your code. It doesn't need it, actually, it's fine, it's what you expect from the compiler. Who would expect it to actually analyze your data? Probably not your security department. So, we do that. On the one hand, I really love these checks. On the other hand, there are some checks I usually recommend to turn off when there is some slowness, because, as you can expect, data flow analysis is not that fast. It analyzes the whole data.. So yeah, it's cool that you can actually run it on a CI server. When we install CLion, we can run all this code analysis just on the CI server. For example, we can run the data flow. When we did a few code analysis checks, we found that there is a nice Clang Tidy analyzer, which is done by the LLVM community and is part of the LLVM infrastructure. Let's see if we have some nice example here. Yeah, so what we did was we bundled Clang Tidy into CLion. So when you get some checks from Clang Tidy, they are marked as a Clang Tidy check. And you can get them the same way as you get CLion's own code analysis checks. And there are quick-fixes from Clang Tidy.. Here is the modernize group, so I can, for example, convert lambda to std::bind, or here it suggests using a range-based for. I can do that, as well. Pass by value and use std::move, why not? To be honest, we have only 60 or 70 of our own checks. With Clang Tidy from LLVM 8.0, the recent release which we bundle, there are 330 checks. Not all of them are reasonable, so we try to limit the default configuration a little bit. So we don't turn them on by default because there are dozens of checks. Some are created by Google, some are created by other companies. They may have some particular checks they need that you probably don't. You can tune the configuration in the code inspections. You can actually select which profile for a Clang Tidy you would like to get. You can check them here in the list or you can just provide a Clang Tidy file and your project will read the configuration from it.. Do you know what the best thing about Clang Tidy is? It's an open-source linter which you can extend easily. Yes, you can have a specific check for a team. No IDE will implement it for you because it's very specific to your project. But you want your team to get it in the IDE and to force them to fix it.. What you can do is you can implement and check it on top of Clang Tidy. That's very easy. There are dozens of samples across the Internet with huge documentation. So you just get this Abstract Syntax Tree by build by Clang and do a check. And then you can actually specify the Clang Tidy executable in CLion and use a custom Clang Tidy executable. That means you will get all your checks the same way in the IDE as you do currently. So that's a good thing. It is always good to know that you can actually extend the thing. And of course, when we learned that we could extend Clang Tidy, we actually decided, why not implement a couple of our own checks just to see how it works. And we did that.. We started by taking one very interesting check that we call argument selection defects. The interesting part is that there is a huge scientific paper behind this check. So what does it do? I have a function called get_User here, which gets the company ID and the user ID. And I made a mistake – the order of the parameters is wrong here. So I passed user ID and then company ID. But they are the same type, so the compiler will just miss it. It's fine to compile this code. And I might miss that as well.. There is a paper written by Google people who actually implemented some heuristic algorithm for detecting that the order is wrong based on the name of the arguments and the parameters. So if you are good at naming your parameters, if the names are reasonable, and if you don't name your parameters crazily, then it should guess nicely if you miss the order. So definitely we've turned it off for all the short names, like X, Y, Z, and we turned it off for all the functions like swap. Because naturally, doing a swap means you are swapping the arguments – that's fine. So this paper actually takes all these things into account and they implemented it. And, of course, you can call a quick-fix and it will switch it in all these usages where the order is missing. So we did a few checks like that.. There is another check that I can probably show you here. Do you know why it is suggesting to rename? I will tell you. It is because I have a naming conversion configured for my project. So if we go to the code style settings, you'll find this nice UI—we are making it even bigger and more flexible in the next version; we'll get more options here. The idea is that it's much easier to read the code if the naming convention is proper. So if the whole team is following the same naming convention, then a new person entering the team can easily guess by the code if it's a function, or a class, or a private method, or maybe a public function, if it's a macro, if it's an enum, so whatever. So reading the code when you have a name in the convention is easier, so we support it.. You can see the list of entity kinds here on the left. You can configure a custom prefix, custom suffix, and you can select the proper style. And you can actually apply it from a known convention that we have predefined for you here. Google and LLVM all have some predefined naming conventions. This check, actually, tells me that the name is not correct. It doesn't follow the conventions. So then naturally, we can do a quick-fix with renaming and we will update all the usages. It's a good thing to force your team to use. And naturally, you can configure it and share the settings in the version controls so that the whole team is on the same configuration.. OK, that is enough of code analysis. Let's do something more exciting. What could be more exciting than refactoring in C++? I have a function here, callPerson. What I will do, I will change the signature. And changing the signature, I will do another parameter at the same time. You can see the completion here. I will call it a bad name – don't use this name in the convention – I am calling the parameter p1 for the demo. So you see I have the usage of the callPerson function, and I will substitute it with the default value – just to keep my code compilable. You now can find usages of this function and actually change the value you actually need in all these places. But at least by default you have some nice value. And if I do the Change Signature again and swap the order, if I still have the wrong order, it might be not good because I have now ‘p’ there. Probably something will go wrong. Let's hope for the best.. We have swapped them. Cool. I'm safe. That's why I like the automatic refactorings with the IDE – because they keep me safe.. Let's now extract something. Let's close this to show you more. I have this function extractSample, and it's called here. I have a few things to extract. I will first of all extract this value. You can see we have lots of extracts here – whatever you want to extract from your C++ code. I'll extract a parameter. It is nice that it asks me first, “I see 10 occurrences of this value. Do you want me to extract all of them”? Of course I do. I think not just occasionally. Let's do that. I will call it ‘D’ for something. I can declare a constant if I want. Here, I have my parameter. Let's come back to usage. Here is my value. Cool.. Let's extract something else. Let's extract this expression – the whole expression – to a variable. Extract variable. Again, there’s more than one occurrence. OK, let's check them all. You see them highlighted. You see that the expression was actually more complicated. It managed to extract part of it, okay. So I will extract these occurrences. They will be substituted and everything is fine. So I can extract typedef, I can extract define, I can extract functions. So all these things are possible.. And one last thing about the refactoring – have you ever dealt with pulling members up and down through the hierarchy? I will show you because not everybody may have seen this before. There is Pull Members Up, or Down. And when you call it, that's fantastic. Now, it not only asks me where to pull my method for this hierarchy, but it also highlights some things from my class in red, telling me, “it is probably used by the method you are going to pull up. You will need that.” So you will know to select them and to pull them up and down your hierarchy.. OK, refactoring was nice. Resolve context, we also got it. Let's do a nice debugging demo. I guess regular debugging would be no fun. We'll do some cool debugging demo. For this, I will need my Linux machine. It's a virtual Linux machine running here in parallel on my Mac.. What I want to do, there is a nice and magic word, remote debug, which actually helps us to debug and develop when we're not on the target machine. Because in most cases we're not. We're using the machine that our company gave us, or the machine we prefer, or just the machine which is convenient because we, for example, have everything installed on it. But we are developing for another platform, embedded platform, or just some other architecture, or another target platform, or maybe it's just not possible to debug on your local machine for some reason.. So we have two types of remote configurations: first, there is the case when you just want to debug on the remote machine. So you're working locally, your code is local, so all the things here, but then you have some different architecture you want to debug. Well, we suggest you use the GDB server remote debug configuration. It's very straightforward, very simple. If you go to edit configurations, it's called “GDB remote debug.” So what did I actually provide here? The name, that's simple enough, GDB. So you can switch it, but, by default, we bundle the GDB build for multiple architectures already. So we don't just bundle the GDB for the particular architecture for this binary for my Mac. I have this binary for CLion when it was installed, but it has the GDB build for multiple architectures already. You still can switch it if you have some very specific platform for which you actually got your GDB compiled from GDB tools, but in most cases, you will be fine with the bundled version.. So I provided the connection I will be using, the address, and the port. Symbol file, what's that? For debugging, you need some debug symbols. Where do you get them? The easiest way is just to take the binary, which you will be running and debugging there. If it's built with debug flags, it has the debug symbols. OK, so I will just copy this binary to my local machine and provide it here for the symbol file.. And the last thing is path mappings. For CLion to understand the breakpoints I will be setting in my editor and to show me all the things in my code, it actually needs to understand how my local paths are mapped to the paths on the remote machine where I build the binary. If I build it locally for that architecture, that's fine. It's the same paths and you don't need the path mappings. But if, for example, it was built on some CI server with a different architecture, the paths to the sources are probably different. And the debug symbols will be used in this direct path to the sources. So we have to know the mapping.. So okay, we have successfully provided all these things. Now, all we have to do is to go to my virtual machine and start the GDB server. So it just starts the GDB server for localhost, which is my Linux port 8080 and my binary. And it's now listening in on the port. I will now go to the remote app and call the debug. The debugger in CLion is connected to my remote machine, to my Linux. And now it actually stopped on a breakpoint. What can I do now? I can do some stepping. So here is my editor on my Mac. I do some stepping.. Do you know what this is? We call it the Inline Variables view, and it is my favorite feature in the debugger. When you debug, you can see the actual values of different variables right in the editor. So you don't need to switch or hover over something to see them. And the good thing is that if I select the variable here – I’ll change the value to 300 – you'll see that it is colored in orange which shows me that it has updated it. And I can see the updated value. And I can go forward and step through the things that can evaluate expressions here, run to cursor, do all kinds of stepping, and actually debug your application. And this whole application, if I stop it here, probably we'll see, there is a game running here on my Linux. I was debugging that game. OK, so I'll stop it here.. Sometimes a remote debugger is not enough to deal with things. Sometimes I need something more complicated, the whole cycle of remote development. This means I have my local machine, but I have to compile, run, and debug my code on another remote machine, like Docker, or maybe some other architecture. You can do that. How it works In CLion is we actually build the configuration when we take the local sources and synchronize them to the remote machine using CLion. And then we synchronize such paths back at the header. I will show you why in a couple of minutes. We'll do this last synchronization.. So first: what do you have to configure? Nice question. So all you need is a toolchain, specifically a remote toolchain. It'll go to the same Linux host. I have provided some credentials to this machine here. And it now tries to connect to my remote machine and asks if I actually have all the tools I need, like the make, the C and C++ compiler. OK, it detected all the tools – I have them.. We implemented the remote GDB debug in a general way. It works for any project model supported. You probably know we're a little bit more than CMake right now. We have Gradle for C++ and compilation database. Remote GDB debug works for all three. Full remote mode now works only for CMake, so that's why I need to provide a CMake profile. So I'll do that, that's just a remote profile used in my remote toolchain. That's it. Cool. What we can do now is run it. Let's switch the configuration to show you in detail. So first of all, my debug configuration is a local configuration. So that the application simply prints this name. So let's run it.. Since I'm running it locally, it says my computer’s OS is Darwin. OK, let's now switch to the remote toolchain. Now, let's run. Oh, cool. I got Linux. That's actually the name of my remote machine. So what actually happened in the background, it actually connected to my remote machine, compiled the code there, ran it, and provided the output here. You can debug the same way, in a remote way. The thing that I like is, again, about the preprocessor branches. You see that here Linux is actually highlighted because I'm using the remote configuration. If we switch to the local configuration, naturally, the Mac branch will be highlighted. That's what I expect from my tool, to highlight the proper branch for me. If I'm working with a remote machine, the Linux branch will be highlighted for me. So that's the remote debug and the remote development mode.. Now, just a few words about integration. IDE, do you know what it stands for? Integrated Development Environment. That means that it is the whole environment, it is not just about the code. So what do we have? It is a regular IntelliJ-based IDE, so you can guess we have all the old version control support and all this stuff. That is not that exciting. Let's do some exciting stuff, like who actually uses Valgrind? Anyone? Cool. Yeah, you're my favorites. I like this tool very much. So we actually integrated the Valgrind memory check.. So that's nice for catching memory leaks in your program. So what you can do is, you can run the application with Valgrind memory check. I'm not going to run it on remote as I don't have it there. I’ll run it locally. It actually gets you to this nice output here. This Valgrind tab and what you can see here is just the whole stack trace of all the leaks. I actually recommend that you run the integrated tools from the IDE, and not separately. If I ran my application in Valgrind separately from the terminal, I would miss is the actual navigation to my code and my editor because here I actually have the code. I can jump to the source code in the editor so I can go and fix the problem immediately just from this trace.. That is it for Valgrind. But there is another tool in the community which is very popular for checking all possible kinds of addresses and other things – that’s sanitizers. Sanitizers are a bit different from Valgrind. Valgrind is just a tool, you run your application onto Valgrind. With sanitizers, you have to recompile your code, so the functionality is implemented in a different way.. If we detect the -fsanitize flag in your compile options, then we know that you're probably using some sanitizers. Cool. If you simply run your application, there will be a tab with sanitizer output. And just the same, you can go for the stack trace and you can navigate to the source code. And the good thing about the sanitizers is that there are so many of them: address sanitizers, memory sanitizer, leak sanitizer, thread sanitizer, and undefined behavior sanitizer. There are some drawbacks, for example, it's only supported for some Clang versions and some newer GCC versions starting from version 5. Both Valgrind and sanitizers do not work in Windows – these tools do not like the Windows platform. Sorry, Windows users. But still, it's good to check them out and you can provide some settings here.. What else is left from the dynamic analysis? Valgrind, sanitizers, what else? Anyone? Profiler.. So if you need to profile your code, and if you're lucky enough not to be on Windows, sorry, we don't have profiler for Windows currently. We have it on Linux and Mac. On Linux, we're using perf on Mac we're using DTrace. And so I can profile my application here. It will start the profiler. It tells me that the profile it attached and waiting for my application. Now, I can open the profiler, I can look at the flame chart for all the threads or some particular thread. I can go to a call tree, I can go to the methods list, and again, I can jump to the source. So if you have the profiler output, it's actually linked to the source code. So just profile your code. Follow the problem and then go to your code and fix it. It is that easy.. Static analysis, dynamic analysis... What else are we missing to write perfect C++ code? I asked in the very beginning, but there were just not that many hands from people who were doing unit tests. Unit tests, naturally. CLion has integration with Google Test, boost.Test, and Catch. I love Catch not because Phil Nash, who is the author, is our developer advocate, but because it's a nice framework. It is header-only, so, despite Google Tests, which you actually have to link with the whole library, you can actually just include the catch header file and you are done.. So I have some tests here. When you see these nice gutter icons, they're actually showing me the state of the test from my previous run. So some tests actually succeeded, some tests failed, but also this is the run icon. So I can just go, \"OK, run the test for me,\" and I will get this nice unit test window with the test runner output. I can investigate the tests, I can export the results, I can compare with what I previously got here. I can do all these kinds of things. Boost.Test is the same, so just the unit test, which can run.. If you ask me which is my favorite feature for the unit test integration, I will tell you just one. It's called “rerun all the tests that actually failed.” And a very direct case where this is very useful: imagine you have 200 unit tests, half of them failed. You have to fix them because before that, your team lead said, \"No, don't commit this code, all the tests are failing.\" You have to fix them, so what do you do? You're constantly rerunning the test that failed to try to fix the current one until it goes to zero, and then you just check the whole bunch from scratch just to be sure that you haven't broken anything again. So that's a very nice workflow. So just rerunning the tests and just saying, \"OK, I can just rerun all the tests that failed. I don't need to select them manually”, that's quite helpful. That’s unit tests.. That is probably mostly it for the exciting parts. Just one last quick word about CMake. As I said, we are not only about CMake these days. We have support for a compilation database in Gradle C++, but CMake is still is a first-class citizen for CLion. So we treat it as a language. So if you start typing in CMake files, you will see the code completion. And all these file names are the actual links to the file. So I can actually go to them using the usual “Go to declaration” shortcut.. And there are Live Templates, so if you've heard about Live Templates in the IntelliJ Platform, this is just the template you can configure, put some code that you use most often, and then call it with a short combination of letters. You can provide Live Templates for CMake as well. We have some for Google Tests and Boost.Test.. So you can do all these things. Install CMake and it will be supported and will appear here in the build tool window. So that's why I call CMake support a first-class citizen. But again, it's not just about CMake nowadays. There is the compilation database, which I treat as a nice workaround for makefiles. If you use makefiles and we still don't support them, you can use compilation database. We have a whole tutorial in our help about how to do that. So go and try it.. So that's mostly it. I hope you enjoyed the demo and it wakes you up a little bit.. Yeah, and I think they will have a nice raffle and some closing words. I think you were waiting for that, yeah?. Products. Solutions. Initiatives. Community. Resources. Company"

CLion 2021.1 is enhancing the code analysis experience by upgrading Data Flow Analysis to global mode, expanding MISRA support, and integrating with Clazy for Qt projects. In the debugger, GDB and LLDB have reached feature parity for Core Dump debugging. And finally, remote mode has a wider range of abilities and works consistently across several project models.. Free 30-day trial. Data Flow Analysis. Data flow analysis (DFA) tracks the flow of data in your code and detects potential issues based on that analysis. In addition to the local DFA (which works within a single function), CLion 2021.1 includes global DFA (which takes a whole translation unit of a program as a single unit for analysis). Global DFA not only enriches the already existing checks but also adds several new unique inspections.. Enhancing local checks with global DFA. The list of current DFA-based inspections that benefit from global DFA includes:. New global DFA checks. A few new inspections have been added that only make sense when analyzing globally – running DFA on a whole translation unit of a program:. Performance improvements. CLion 2021.1 also optimizes many steps in DFA. The performance measurements on Postgres, Eigen, and Clangd projects, among others, show that the overall performance is good and that some characteristics have improved (such as the number of files where DFA execution was terminated by CLion because of a timeout).. Learn more. Take a short tour. Dynamic analysis. Branch coverage. In addition to line coverage, CLion 2021.1 can now also calculate Branch Coverage. This method takes into account all the branches of each control structure. Run your CMake application or tests with coverage and check out the new column that’s been added to the Coverage tool window.. Branch coverage is enabled by default and can be adjusted in Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Coverage, but it only works with GCC/gcov or version 12.0.0 and higher of LLVM/llvm-cov.. Dynamic analysis in Remote mode. In order to reach feature consistency across all toolchains, project models, and configurations, CLion 2021.1 makes it possible for Google Sanitizers, Valgrind Memcheck, and Code Coverage to work with remote toolchains.. MISRA C and C++ checks. CLion 2021.1 adds more checks from MISRA C 2012 and MISRA C++ 2008. The full list is maintained on our confluence page and allows you to easily track the progress.. Postfix completion for C and C++. Postfix code completion for C and C++ lets you add code around an expression you’ve just typed. It can wrap an expression with a frequently used language construct, or pass the expression as the first argument of a free function.. Wrap the expression with language construct. Postfix templates can help you with common language constructs. Type an expression then a dot, and then add the postfix template abbreviation and press the expansion key, or select the required template from the completion list that appears. The expanded template will wrap the given expression. Find the full list of templates in Preferences | Editor | General | Postfix Completion.. Pass the expression to a free function. Use postfix code completion to pass the expression you’ve just typed to a free function as the first argument. Type an expression, then a dot, and select a free function from the completion list that appears.. Take a short tour. Enhancements for Makefile projects. Initial support for Remote Makefile projects. CLion 2021.1 allows you to work with Makefile projects on a remote machine. Change the toolchain in the Makefile settings to a remote one, then reload the project and it will synchronize with the remote machine. Compile, run, and debug your application remotely from your locally running CLion.. Check out known issues and limitations.. Makefile Language plugin. The Makefile Language plugin (previously 3rd-party) is now maintained by the CLion team and comes bundled in CLion. The plugin provides make syntax highlighting, quick documentation, Find Usages for targets, and a variety of navigation and code completion actions for Makefile.. Take a short tour. Enhancements for CMake projects. Share CMake Profiles in VCS. CMake Profile settings in CLion are now stored in a cmake.xml file in the .idea directory and can be shared in the VCS along with the project. Simply select the Share option in Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | CMake.. CLion 2021.1 bundles CMake 3.19. In addition to the other changes it introduces, this is the first CMake version to support Apple Silicon (M1 chip).. CMake 3.19 features for CUDA are now supported in CLion, which includes autocompletion for a few new CMake variables.. Take a short tour. Enhancements for Qt projects. Clazy integration. Clazy, a Qt-oriented static code analyzer, is now integrated into CLion’s Clangd-based engine. CLion currently uses version 1.8. Checks are displayed in the editor and quick-fixes are also available.. Users can configure CLion’s severity level and the level of the Clazy checks in Preferences | Editor | Inspections | C/C++ | General | Clazy.. QtCreator keymap. For those used to the key bindings in QtCreator, CLion now bundles the QtCreator keymap. You can switch to it in Settings or via a Quick Switch Scheme action (⌃`).. Debugger. Set Execution Point in disassembly. The Set Execution Point action lets you jump to an arbitrary line of code in the editor during a debug session and set the execution point there, skipping all the other commands in between. It now works in the disassembly view, so you can move the execution point while stepping through the assembly code.. Core dumps debugging. When debugging core dumps in CLion 2021.1, users can now set sysroot in the corresponding run configuration. This will help localize library symbols when debugging core dumps from binaries built on other systems.. Explicitly setting symbol files when debugging a core dump for non-symbolized binary with LLDB now also provides necessary information about the symbols to CLion. With this fix, GDB and LLDB have reached feature parity for core dump debugging in CLion!. Take a short tour. Remote terminal. A new Tools | Open Remote Host Terminal action opens the project directory on the remote host if it exists. The remote host corresponds to the remote profile that is currently selected, or if a local one is selected, the first remote profile found in the project.. Project view. Source files located outside of the project root are now grouped under the External Sources node in the Project tree. This helps prevent the top-level crowding of these files.. VCS. Profile for pre-commit inspections. CLion can inspect your code before you commit it to help you make sure there are no bugs. Choose a code inspection profile before committing changes to VCS – click the gear icon to display the commit options, select the Analyze code checkbox, click Choose profile, and select the desired profile.. Git commit templates. You can create a custom commit message template in Git and CLion will display this text as an initial commit message.. Save to Shelf. A new Save to Shelf action allows you to copy your changes to the Shelf while keeping them in the local changes. You can access this action by pressing ⇧⌘A and typing ‘Save to Shelf’.. Learn more about other VCS improvements across all IntelliJ-based products.. Rust plugin update. IntelliJ Rust now provides a structured view for the compiler’s build output. The tab opens automatically in the Build tool window when you call a Cargo command that includes a build step. This new feature works with Cargo versions 1.48.0 or later.. Another significant update is the new Change Signature refactoring. It helps you modify a function/method signature, affecting all references. You can quickly change a function’s name or return type, reorder or add/remove parameters, and add an async or unsafe prefix.. The Rename refactoring now gives renaming suggestions for elements like structs, functions, and local variables when you change a name in the editor.. Conditional compilation support has been improved. Find Usages is now available for Cargo features, and completion works for the feature argument in the cfg and cfg_attr attributes. Also, if there are nested attributes inside cfg_attr, the plugin takes that into account during name resolution and code analysis.. Code With Me. Code With Me, a new JetBrains service for collaborative development and pair programming, is now bundled with CLion.. Set the required level of access to your project and share the link with your guests. Your peers do not even need to have an IDE of their own installed to collaborate with you. Embedded audio and video calls, along with chat messaging, will help teams discuss the code, share their knowledge, and cooperate more efficiently.. To learn more about the availability of Code With Me with your current JetBrains license, check out the pricing page.. Space integration. The Space plugin is now available for CLion. You can connect to your organization in JetBrains Space via Get from VCS, located right on the welcome screen.

CLion 2020.3 brings significant, eagerly anticipated improvements to key parts of the development process – code analysis, running and debugging applications, and unit testing. For embedded projects, CLion now comes with initial MISRA C and C++ support. And Qt users can benefit from IDE features tuned specifically for working with Qt code.. Free 30-day trial. Debugger. Debug as Root. CLion 2020.3 can run and debug your application with root privileges – you just need to select this option in the corresponding Run/Debug configuration. This works for CMake, Makefile, Gradle Native, Custom Build, and CTest applications.. Debugging with Core Dumps. A new Run | Open Core Dump… action available for Linux and macOS allows you to open an existing core dump of a crashed process in CLion and debug it there. Users can inspect the frames and variables view, check the memory and disassembly view, evaluate expressions, and run debugger commands from the debugger console. Read more about this feature’s configuration process and known limitations.. Set Execution Point. With a new Set Execution Point to Cursor action, you can move back and forth though your program’s execution while debugging, break loops or restart them, select another branch in an if-else clause or switch-case statement, and even skip loops completely. It is as simple as dragging-and-dropping an arrow in the gutter to the line you are interested in.. Learn more. Interactive hints and Inline watches. Now when the application is running in debug mode, the editor displays clickable inline hints that you can expand to see all the fields belonging to a given variable. Moreover, you can change the variable values inside the drop-down list or add an arbitrary expression as an Inline Watch to this place in the code.. Take a short tour. Run Settings. Configure environment with a script. In CLion, you can now use a script to specify the environment in which a Run/Debug configuration will be launched. You'll find the new setting for this in all Application and Unit Testing configurations.. Edit configurations while indexing. No more waiting! Run/Debug configurations can be edited while the project is being indexed.. Take a short tour. Unit testing. CTest support. CTest, a CMake-specific test runner, is now supported in CLion. This means the list of tests that are run with CTest is detected, and the IDE automatically creates run/debug configurations for them. When tests are launched, the results are presented in the built-in test runner, from which you can debug tests, rerun only failed tests, and much more.. Learn more. Test runner for Google Test. Version 2020.3 enhances CLion’s support for Google Test, the most popular C++ unit testing framework in the world (Developer Ecosystem Research in 2020 shows that 31% of C++ developers use Google Test).. Take a short tour. Code analysis and refactoring. MISRA C and C++. CLion 2020.3 brings partial support for MISRA C 2012 and MISRA C++ 2008, guidelines used widely in embedded development and especially in the automotive industry. This support speeds up the development of such projects by revealing incompatibilities earlier in the development cycle. The list of currently supported checks is available on CLion’s Confluence page.. Unused value. CLion 2020.3 improves the Unused Value inspection, which catches situations where a variable value is never used after it has been assigned. It can now also be tuned to follow the style that recommends using default variable initializers. A new option to turn the inspection off in such cases has been added to the settings.. Extract Lambda Parameter. A new Extract Lambda Parameter refactoring has been added to CLion. It extracts an expression or statement into a new parameter with a lambda expression passed as a corresponding argument. The statement could, for example, be a comparator passed to a sorting function.. Watch Extract Refactorings in Action. Code completion. Clang completion snippets. Clang completion snippets help you insert common constructs when C++ keywords are typed. In some cases, when completing a typedef keyword, for example, code completion can suggest not only the keyword itself but also stubs for the type and the new name.. Completion for templates. CLion 2020.3 improves code completion, as it now works much more accurately with template types. For example, completion options are displayed for container elements and iterators in the function template.. Take a short tour. Qt projects. Create a new Qt project. The New Project dialog suggests the Qt Console Executable and Qt Widgets Executable project types. You can also select the Qt CMake prefix path, the C++ language standard to be used in the project, and the Qt version. The new project is generated using the corresponding templates.. Create a new Qt UI Class. A new QT UI Class item in the New menu (⌘N) helps you simultaneously create a Qt class along with a .ui file. Fill in the class name and select the parent class (QWidget, QMainWindow, or QDialog). .h/.cpp/.ui files will be generated using the Filename base as their file names. The generated files follow the templates listed in Settings/Preferences | Editor | File and Code Templates – Qt Class, Qt Class Header, and Qt Designer Form.. Complete signals and slots. Signals and slots are central features of Qt, as they are the entities used for communication between objects. CLion now understands when signals or slots have to be completed, and it filters only the corresponding members in the completion dropdown.. Auto-import in Qt style. Auto-import suggestions in Qt projects in CLion 2020.3 are tuned to follow the most commonly used style for Qt.. Take a short tour. Makefile projects. Support for projects using libtool, dolt, and ccache. Makefile projects using various wrappers like ccache, libtool, dolt, slibtool, and jlibtool can now be successfully loaded in CLion. Read more about some of the limitations that remain.. Run/Debug configurations. Setting up a Makefile project in CLion is now even easier – the Run/Debug configurations are created automatically for the targets in the top-level Makefile when loading the project. Now to run and debug, you just need to point the configuration to the built executable.. Learn more. Recompile single file. The Recompile action (⇧⌘F9) helps speed up the development process by compiling a single file without building the whole project. It now works for Makefile projects, too!. Take a short tour. CMake. Enable/Disable CMake Profiles. With CLion 2020.3, it’s now possible to keep several CMake profiles configured in CLion while disabling the ones that are not currently in use. This improves the project loading times and saves from the redundant failures from temporarily unavailable profiles (like for the remote configurations which are currently shut down). The option is available from the CMake tool window and the CMake Profiles settings dialog.. Learn more. VCS. Git tab in Search Everywhere. The Search Everywhere dialog now includes a Git tab. It helps with finding commit hashes and messages, tags, and branches. You can also perform simple mathematical calculations in the search field.. UI updates. The VCS menu is now named according to the version control system in use. We’ve made the menu more concise, removing all but the most useful actions for versioning your project.. Additionally, now the two most popular buttons – Commit and Commit and Push… – are explicitly shown on the Commit screen.. Git staging support. You can now stage changes directly from CLion. To enable this feature, go to Preferences/Settings | Version Control | Git and tick the Enable staging area checkbox. Click the + icon to add your files to the new Staged node in the Commit view. You can also stage changes right from the gutter or in the Diff view. To learn more, read our blog post.. Remote development. Automatic update of Exclude paths. Directories marked as Excluded locally are now automatically marked as Excluded paths for remote toolchains when they are initially being configured. And when changes are made to an already synchronized project, CLion shows an update notification and suggests updating the list of Excluded paths.. Learn the details. Code With Me. CLion 2020.3 supports Code With Me (EAP), a new service from JetBrains for collaborative development and pair programming. Code With Me enables you to share the project you currently have open in your IDE with others, and work on it together in real time. You can download it today from the plugin marketplace (Preferences / Settings | Plugins | Marketplace). Check out these posts to learn more about Code With Me.. UI update. Updates to Welcome screen. CLion 2020.3 gets a revamped Welcome screen. The new layout puts the most common operations at your fingertips and gives you immediate access to recent projects, customization options, and plugin settings.. Splitting an editor. It’s now possible to split an editor by dragging and dropping a tab to the side of the main editor window. The Open in Right Split action splits the editor vertically upon opening a file.. You can invoke the action from the Project view or from other navigation popups, such as Recent Files and Search Everywhere (⇧Enter).. IDE theme synced with OS settings. CLion can now synchronize with your OS theme. To enable this feature, go to Settings / Preferences | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance and tick the Sync with OS checkbox. Click the gear icon next to Sync with OS to select your preferred theme.. Rust plugin update. IntelliJ Rust now fully supports Cargo features and allows you to configure them with a smart new UI. Features of a workspace can be toggled on and off with a single click, and the plugin’s code assistance will take these settings into account. Check out the details in this blog post.. Also, the plugin now allows using Rustfmt as the default code formatter. Just set the corresponding checkbox in Settings / Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | Rust | Rustfmt, and the whole file reformatting will employ Rustfmt. For now, if you call Reformat Code on a selection, the IDE’s formatter will be used instead.. The plugin’s project wizard has been enhanced with more templates and the option to use custom cargo-generate templates.. Other updates include the introduction of WebAssembly project support and a new experimental engine for name resolution.. Free 30-day trial. What's New in CLion 2020.2. CLion 2020.2 ensures that a variety of C++ projects are covered by adding Makefile projects and polishing CMake support. It provides better C++20 standard compliance. Code analysis is now more accurate and catches more critical errors, like dangling pointers. Unit testing, code coverage, embedded development, and other areas were also significantly enhanced.. Free 30-day trial. Project models. Makefile project support. Developing a Makefile-based project? Benefit from CLion’s smart features – CLion now comes with Makefile project support out of the box. Open a folder with a top-level Makefile as a project, or directly point CLion to a Makefile in the Open dialog. The IDE will run make (with the --just-print option to avoid running an actual build), parse the output of the make command, and load the project. Check out the details, known limitations, and a long list of projects we’ve tested our approach with in this blog post.. Take a short tour. Enhanced CMake UX. The CMake Profile settings under Build, Execution, Deployment | CMake have a newly polished UI, with a few useful tips added for the settings there. In addition, several actions for CMake projects are now available in Find Action, and you can assign a shortcut to any or all of them if you use them regularly:. CMake upgrade. CLion now bundles CMake 3.17 and adds initial support for two of its most recent features:. Take a short tour. Building projects. The Recompile single file action helps speed up the development process by quickly checking local changes, and it is now available for Ninja and other generators used in CMake and supported in CLion.. Thanks to an important bug fix, CLion can now build multiple independent projects in parallel, without them blocking each other from starting.. Code analysis. Code analysis in CLion 2020.2 got a massive update, increasing the accuracy of many checks and covering more cases. This version also continues the work of polishing the Data Flow Analysis, reimplemented previously on top of the Clangd-based engine.. Dangling pointer. Pointers that point to invalid data lead to run-time issues. Typical cases are double-free and use-after-free combinations. CLion now catches such dangling pointers if they appear in the local scope, no pointer arithmetic is involved, and macros are not preventing CLion from performing the analysis.. Simplify. The Simplify code inspection is now more accurate and covers more cases. It works for the following types of statements:. The cases can be configured separately in Preferences | Editor | Inspections | C/C++ | General | Simplifiable statement .. Loop condition is never updated. This CLion inspection detects situations where a loop condition is not updated inside the loop. It’s similar to Clang-Tidy’s clang-tidy:bugprone-infinite-loop but works for loops with exit points and can handle cases with lambdas or references.. Unused code. The Unused code inspection has been massively overhauled. Among other changes, it now works for type aliases, for both globally and locally defined using constructs.. Inspection Widget and Problems View. Last but not least, we’ve introduced a new Inspection Widget. It displays the number of warnings and errors in the current file and lets you navigate between them with ease. You can also configure the highlighting level (just like you could previously with the so-called Hector icon).. If you click on the Inspection Widget, the Problems View tool window will open (View | Tool Window | Problems). It shows the list of warnings and errors in the current file, helps you navigate to the place in your code where the problem was encountered, and allows you to fix the issues by invoking the Alt+Enter shortcut right from the tool window.. Take a short tour. C++20. This year officially brings a new language standard to C++ developers, and CLion already comes with support for many of its features. The language engine in CLion 2020.2 is also generally more stable on C++20 code.. C++20 keywords. Newly added keywords are supported by CLion 2020.2 in code highlighting and completion:. Designated initializers. Code completion in designated initializers now works for fields from a base class.. explicit(bool). The C++20 explicit(bool) construct is now highlighted correctly. It’s also equipped with name hints for condition arguments and is supported in navigation and refactoring.. Range-based for with initializer. Range-based for loops with the init statement are now supported. This includes refactorings like Rename for variables in the loop.. Constrain a function's result. A new inspection for code that uses Concepts has been added. It suggests constraining local variables declared as auto if the result of a constrained function call is assigned to them.. Take a short tour. Unit testing. Doctest support. Catch2 template tests. These types of tests in Catch2 are now recognized and handled just like the other test types.. Skipping tests in Google Test. The GTEST_SKIP() macro in Google Test provides the ability to skip tests at runtime. This is now supported by CLion.. Take a short tour. Code coverage. CLion 2020.2 improves the user experience by adding coverage flags automatically when you click the Run with Coverage button. Now, if your currently selected CMake profile doesn’t include compiler options for coverage, CLion will search for a CMake profile (and create one if not found) with the coverage flags passed via CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and CMAKE_C_FLAGS.. Embedded development: PlatformIO plugin. For embedded development, we’ve updated a plugin for PlatformIO, bringing significant improvements:. Highlighting in platformio.ini files. PlatformIO project configuration files are now highlighted properly, so you can read and update them more easily.. New Run/Debug configurations. When a new project is created from the New Project Wizard in CLion, many useful Run/Debug configurations are added automatically. For example, _PROGRAM, _MONITOR, _CLEAN, _TEST, and many others.. CMake Profiles for PlatformIO configurations. CLion now automatically creates CMake Profiles for the CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES entries in the PlatformIO CMake project.. VCS. Git installed in WSL2. If you develop with the WSL2 toolchains and use Git on WSL2, you will now benefit from CLion switching between Git executables depending on the project location. It will auto-detect the Git executable from WSL2 for projects opened from there (via \\\\wsl$ path) and switch all Git-related features to work with it.. GitHub Pull Requests. CLion 2020.2 introduces a new and more spacious view for GitHub Pull Requests. It shows all the details of a particular pull request (like messages, branch names, author, assignee, changed files, commits, and timeline) and displays the results of the pre-commit checks. It also helps with many actions like start a review, request reviews, attach comments, or merge pull requests from within the IDE.. Learn more. Go to Declaration or Usages. The Go to Declaration or Usages action (⌘Click / ⌘B / force-touch) behaves differently depending on the case and the IDE settings:. Performance improvements. A few UI freezes and slowdowns have been fixed. To avoid editor performance degradation, CLion now inserts a backslash on pressing Enter inside the macro definition. The macro definition will quite likely be continued on a new line, so this saves the IDE from redundantly reparsing activity.. Rust plugin update. In version 0.3 of the plugin, the new engine for macro expansion, which until now had been experimental, is enabled by default. This engine handles macro-generated impl blocks and module declarations, providing code insight for the entirety of your code, including crates like tokio and async-std. Learn more in this blog post.. Another major update is the introduction of initial debugger support for Rust’s MSVC toolchain. Now you can use the LLDB-based debugger bundled in CLion for the Visual Studio toolchain to debug Rust code built on Windows using Rust’s MSVC.. Other enhancements include new refactorings (Move for files and top-level items and Introduce Constant), initial support for or_patterns, error highlighting in format literals inside macros like println!, rendering for documentation in the editor, inlay hints for chain method calls, and improvements to the debugger workflow in IntelliJ IDEA..

Below are examples of what not to do with the JetBrains logo.They are designed to give a general overview of bad practices, and should always be adhered to.. Do Not Place the Tagline Over the Beams. Ensure that the tagline never overlaps any of the beams and follows the rules set out on the previous pages.. Do Not Change the Colors of the Beams. When using the logo, do not change the color of the beams. Always use the master artwork provided when using the logo to ensure accurate reproduction.. Do Not Distort the Logo. Ensure that the JetBrain logo is never squashed or distorted. Always use the master artwork provided when using the logo to ensure accurate reproduction.. Do Not Change the Black Box Color. Ensure that the Black Box is always black and never changed to another color, even from the official color palette.. Do Not Place Beams Over Black Box. Make sure that the beams are never overlapping the Black Box. Whilst the beams can be rearranged, they can never overlap the box.. Do Not Divorce the Beams and the Logo. Whilst the beams can be rearranged they must never appear separate from the Black Box.. Do Not Align the Black Box to the Edge. Ensure that the Black Box always has the minimum clear space around it. Whilst the beams can be cropped, the Black Box cannot.. Do Not Separate the Black Box and Beams. Never use the Black Box without the beams behind. This will make the logo disappear in the background and lose the energy created.. Color Palette. The JetBrains color palette has been created to allow maximum flexibility and give a strong set of colors for use. These colors have also been used to create the corporate and product logos.. black. medium grey. light grey. amber. tangerine. siena. crimson. carmine. fuchsia. lilac. mauve. purple. blue. sky-blue. green. lemon-yellow.

IntelliJ IDEA quickly found a place among top tier Java IDEs, collecting many awards along the way to becoming today’s IDE of choice for polyglot programming.. As a strong proponent of open source, JetBrains made IntelliJ IDEA open source in October of 2009.

AmberCore Software Ltd. helps other companies develop IT products. They especially enjoy working with startups because it lets them apply all their skills as they go from developing and researching initial ideas all the way to bringing new products to market.. «Communication has become faster since we started using Space. I think the deciding factors in choosing to go with Space were its ease of use and versatility.». — Anna Vinogradova, Chief Marketing Officer, AmberCore Software Ltd. Personal information. Greetings!. My name is Anna Vinogradova, I`m the Chief Marketing Officer at AmberCore Software Ltd. My department is responsible for nurturing trusting relationships with partners and customers. Our business function is to spread the word about our company, to facilitate and form partnerships with companies that match our target profile, and to advocate our customers` interests during and after joint projects.. Company information. AmberCore Software Ltd. is a software company with Russian origins. We help other companies develop IT products. We especially enjoy working with startups because we get to apply all our skills as we go from developing and researching their initial ideas all the way to bringing their companies to the market. We always use a project-based approach and work as a single team. We`re convinced that this is the only approach that will allow the IT market to continue its rapid growth, and we want to be among the leaders of that growth.. We make use of a lot of data when developing product ideas. We like to immerse ourselves into projects and find elegant solutions to complicated technical challenges.. This approach requires a lot of organization to ensure that team members are always kept in the loop and information is systematized, but this has to be done without suffocating creativity and inspiration. JetBrains Space helps us bring different parts of the team together in a shared environment where we can discuss tasks in chat, and this helps us come up with new ideas.. Our programmers also use IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, and Rider.. Challenges before adopting Space. What was the problem you were looking to solve?. Have you ever noticed that software developers are very often just code writers, and that they don`t play a deeper role in projects? We wanted to change that – we wanted to really listen to the people who keep their fingers on the pulses of the most advanced technologies, and are always up to speed with the latest information. So we set out to look for a tool that would be powerful yet easy to use, that would funnel all project information into a single pool, and that would make it easy for developers to discuss their tasks with one another instead of sitting isolated in their repository. We tried different solutions. We spent a long time trying out Atlassian products. We even switched from self-hosted GitLab to BitBucket, because GitLab doesn`t have two-way synchronization with Jira. But it turned out that BitBucket and Jira weren`t what we needed.. Now we`ve settled on Space. A key feature in making the decision was its version control system that connects to the issue tracker. This really makes things easier for our team. We have loads of examples where this type of communication can benefit a project, like when a designer and a developer are discussing user journeys, and in the process they quite randomly come up with an ideal solution together.. What solutions did you consider aside from Space?. Like I said before, we spent a long time working with tools from the Atlassian suite – Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket. We opted for the smoother, less cumbersome user experience of Space.. How was your collaboration process organized before Space? Which areas or steps of your process were missing, challenging, or problematic? Were there any problems related to changes in your business, or company transformation issues like rapid growth?. The way we work with customers didn`t change much. But there was one thing that we noticed – development team leads often used to have disagreements with project managers about matters like what tasks to work on, and this led to delays in decision-making which slowed down work on projects. Senior management would have to step in to help make decisions, and since the company was growing rapidly, this problem was consuming more and more of their time. To get around the problem, we gave team leads and project managers equal authority and autonomy to define areas of responsibility in projects. There were some difficult discussions and tense retrospectives at first, but now the problem is solved and there`s a definite spirit of partnership and cooperation between development teams. We now have separate, autonomous teams for each project.. Why Space?. Why did your team decide to use Space?. We tried a variety of tools that all had their own advantages and disadvantages. None of them was able to bring everyone together on a single platform. Marketing went off into their CRM, and developers weren`t happy with synchronization between version control and the issue tracker. Then we gave one of our teams Space to try out... and you know the rest.. What are the key benefits you get from using it?. Within a few weeks we noticed that communication had become faster since we started using Space. Team members reported that they were actually enjoying entering tasks in Space, whereas in other systems it was an unwelcome chore. Everyone was finally communicating on a single platform. We moved the whole company over to Space and our expectations were justified. I think that ease of use and versatility were key factors in deciding to go with Space.. Has Space solved the problems you were facing before? What has changed?. I`ll give you an example. This is a story about how we updated our logo. One fine evening the UX designer and I started thinking about a new logo. We came up with a few ideas but none of them were quite right... So we got our CTO over to have a look and give us some feedback, and it turned out that someone on his team had not just an idea for a new logo, but a concept for the whole website. They just didn`t know where to go with it. Next we got the CEO involved, and then everything got serious and had to be made perfect. Then things really took off. Everyone started contributing ideas to the issue, and we came up with sleeve patches and t-shirts, and some gamification ideas to boost our internal metrics. Now we`re putting it all into action. Our task tracker unexpectedly turned into a communication hub.. Feedback. Describe your experience during the adoption period: was it hard to get used to?. We got used to it very quickly. Creating and tracking tasks is really easy and intuitive.. Is there anything you would like to be improved in Space (e.g. any important features that are missing, usability problems, and so on)?. We really need a Kanban board for marketing, and then I think it could replace our CRM. We`re really looking forward to it :) We`d also like to migrate our internal documentation from Notion to Space, to keep our knowledge base together with everything else.. Would you like to learn more about Space features? If so, how would you like to get that information – in the form of blog posts, Twitter tips, educational videos or webinars, etc.?. I think we`ve got it all figured out. If you are going to publish anything, I`d like to read it on Facebook or on industry websites.. Contacts. Our website: amberproduct.com.

As our team carefully weighed the benefits and shortcomings of building our strategy upon each of the frameworks, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile ultimately emerged as the framework of choice.. Quizlet. Ankush Gupta, Senior Software Engineer, Quizlet. By generating actual Objective-C Frameworks, JavaScript files, and Java bytecode, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile promises the ability to write code in Kotlin and have it run as a first-class citizen on each platform.. Autodesk. Ben Asher, iOS Developer, Autodesk. With Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile an engineer can build out a new feature and test it on one platform, and then other platforms can just hook up the data models and business logic to the UI on their platform and reuse most of the groundwork. Now that we’re working in a shared codebase, we collaborate more across platforms.. IceRock. Aleksandr Pogrebnyak, CEO, IceRock. For anyone looking to introduce Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile into a large project, we would suggest doing so gradually, feature by feature. The technology allows you to do this without any problems, as it`s easy to integrate and begin implementing a simple task for both platforms, which increases the effectiveness of using the technology.. Chalk. Daniel Rampelt, Software Engineer, Chalk. The biggest benefit we’ve received is increased productivity when developing new features for our apps while maintaining a platform-specific, native, and performant UI that our users expect..

Martin Gagnon, Co-Founder & Engineering Lead, Mirego. The multiplatform approach of Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile met our requirements by simplifying the sharing of business logic while empowering the benefits of each platform. Kotlin’s being the main development language for Android, the rapidly growing community, and the great interoperability between Swift and Javascript was the main reason we decided to make the switch.. Yandex. Artem Olkov, Mobile Developer, Yandex. The main gain is that we know that our logic works the same on both iOS and Android applications. It means that we can test our features once and we only need to fix bugs in one place. Also, the single codebase for business logic gives us similar estimates for the new features on both platforms, simplifying the planning process significantly.. DTO.

We use this language in MPS to specify and test our tax calculations and to generate source code for our target platforms.. evolver group. Daniel Schröder, Development Lead, evolver group. Many essential features are available in PhpStorm out of the box (or with free plugins downloadable from the repository), so we don’t need to use any third-party tools. As soon as evolver group switched to PhpStorm, we were able to access all the features we needed for software development, and we found them powerful and simple to use.. bitExpert. Stephan Hochdörfer, Head of IT Business Operations, bitExpert. PhpStorm makes it easy to navigate large codebases, this is especially handy if we take over an existing project from our customers.

Skillaz is a full-cycle cloud hiring system designed to source, attract, select, and hire top talent worldwide.

The 60-strong Skillaz team, which includes 14 developers, is based in Moscow.. «We went with JetBrains because of its ecosystem of tools, whose many capabilities not only improve our productivity but help us work better in other ways, as well.». — Alexander Shtanov, Team Lead, Skillaz. What JetBrains products do you use in your development and how long?. Our backend is written entirely in С#. Most of our developers, both on Windows and on macOS, use Rider to code and perform their other everyday tasks.. In addition, we use two IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate licenses for our architects. This gives us more tools to analyze the performance and quality of our code.. For the user interface, our frontend developers use JetBrains WebStorm with the React/TypeScript stack.. We’ve been using these solutions since August 2018. At first, we bought just a few subscriptions to try things out. We liked everything, and soon after we migrated all of our development to Rider.. Please describe the challenges you faced with adopting JetBrains products:. Before adopting Rider, we used Visual Studio for our .NET development with ReSharper, a very helpful extension that makes writing code and investigating code a lot easier.. Skillaz, the software we make, is a complex system for automating hiring processes that saves recruitment professionals from a lot of routine hassle. ReSharper was based on a very similar philosophy in this sense, as it spared us developers from multiple routine operations and helped us focus on the big picture instead of the minute details.. After a while, though, we realized that setup was not as performant and responsive as we required. Switching between branches was slow, impacting our productivity in no small way. That’s when we decided to try Rider.. As a young development company, we were able to join the JetBrains Startup Discount Program. This looked to us like a very lucrative opportunity, so we bought several subscriptions at 50% off to check out all the tools.. Why did your team decide to apply for the JetBrains Startup Discount?. Skillaz was founded in 2015, so until 2019 we qualified as a startup, and our development team was rather small. As we satisfied all the requirements of the Startup Discount Plan, we took advantage of this opportunity in 2018.. Our team has grown quite a bit since then, so our latest subscriptions were bought at full price.. What have been your biggest gains, as well as your biggest pains, from adopting JetBrains products?. Since we had previous experience using ReSharper, adopting Rider was pretty straightforward. Given our small team at the time, we did not run into any major difficulties, so I guess there were no pains to speak of.. All the features we had become accustomed to in ReSharper were also available in Rider, so that was a huge advantage.. We went with JetBrains because of its ecosystem of tools, whose many capabilities not only improve our productivity but help us work better in other ways, as well. I can identify four key benefits that we’ve gained by switching from Visual Studio to JetBrains tools:. Contacts. skillaz.ruhello@skillaz.ru. Similar Customer Stories. RoadBotics.

We do two things, create bespoke software and deliver developer training. Development accounts for the bulk of our business, but training is also an essential part of our offering. We develop projects and deliver training in Kotlin, TypeScript, Java, C#, and Python, and we are currently building on AWS, Azure, Spring, and Android. Plus of course, Web Apps using React and Angular.. How big is your company?. We are a team of 60+ software engineers, trainers, designers, and product managers, and we are growing.. When did you start?. I started in the industry in the late 90s. I was a software developer for 4–5 years before taking a training role as a temporary lateral move. That was over fifteen years ago. I started with a different (long departed) Irish training company, and then was freelance for a long time. But for the past 7 years, I have been Head of Learning at Instil.. What do you believe in as a company? What is your purpose?. We exist to help invent the future. Our goal is to deliver transformational products and learning experiences to every client. It’s something that we take very seriously.. We are passionate about building products that users love, and enabling our customers to do the same. We have a deep culture of engineering excellence, which is something we try to pass on in all our training.. Problems to solve. Why did you decide to try Space?. We were a sponsor and exhibitor at KotlinConf 2019, in addition to running a workshop on advanced Kotlin coding. So we were present for the official product announcement and were able to talk to some of the developers about what Space was and what it could offer us.. After KotlinConf 2019 the training team requested a Space instance. We became familiar with the basics by using it to manage and extend the sample applications we use in our courses. When the social distancing restrictions were introduced in March 2020, we needed a tool that would let us collaborate online with students as part of virtual deliveries, and Space was the obvious choice.. Space Experience. How do you use Space?. Thanks to our training partnership with JetBrains, we are able to set up a dedicated instance for each virtual delivery. This could be a coding course in TypeScript or Kotlin, or perhaps a workshop where we build a sample application using React, Spring Boot, Ktor, and so on. We then run the delivery as if it were a mini-project, taking advantage of all the features Space provides.. What features does your team love most?. We use blogs extensively for creating setup guides and ad-hoc summaries of problem areas. We encourage students to create their own repos, submit exercise solutions, and request reviews with us. But the integrated chat channels have proved most helpful.. We have two trainers on all fully subscribed deliveries. One is actively instructing whilst the other uses Chat channels to handle any individual difficulties that may arise, especially concerning setup and configuration. The most difficult aspect of virtual training is ensuring that no one falls behind, so it’s great to be able to close the circle and quickly address issues.. How does Space help your work?. Since we started offering virtual deliveries in April, we’ve effectively relaunched the training side of the business and are now busier than ever. Space has been a huge part of that success.. What has changed at work processes?. Besides what we’ve already covered, the automation possibilities in Space are starting to really help us optimize how we manage new deliveries. We can use the HTTP API to automatically populate Space instances with materials and create User Profiles. Going forward we’re hoping to use the ability to launch builds within Docker containers to increase the number of courses we can offer remotely..

In 2018, the team made the decision to look for a more sophisticated solution to help them do their daily work faster. In particular, as the team was doing a lot of code refactoring, they looked for a tool to make that process more efficient. The team came across a lot of positive reviews of WebStorm, so they decided to give it a go. Since then, WebStorm has become a company standard for handling web development tasks and the whole UI team uses it at work on a daily basis.. The key benefits of using WebStorm.

    "content": "Industry: Education, Research. JetBrains products used: MPS. Organization Size: 5,000-10,000. Country: United States. The Weill Cornell Clinical & Translational Science Center. MetaR, built with JetBrains MPS, was developed at the Weill Cornell Medicine Clinical & Translational Science Center to make data analysis easier for biomedical scientists with minimal computational skills.. «MetaR takes advantage of JetBrains MPS to make data analysis with the R language easier. MPS created brand new and unique possibilities for MetaR.». — Manuele Simi, Senior Software Engineer, Weill Cornell Medicine. Problem. Data analysis tools have become essential to the study of biology. The tools available today have been constructed using layers of technology developed over decades. Biologists and clinicians are often called upon to perform basic or advanced data analysis, as their unique knowledge of the experiments that generate the data puts them in the ideal position to perform their own analysis. Yet statistical languages are not always easily accessible to them, and their limited computational experience is often an obstacle.. Solution. The R language is widely used for data analysis in biology. Expert biostatisticians and bioinformaticians have developed many R packages that implement advanced analyses for biological high-throughput data. However, it takes a long time to acquire the computational and statistical knowledge required to fully benefit from the flexibility that R provides.. MetaR applies Language Workbench Technology to create a set of data analysis languages tailored to biologists. These languages automatically generate the underlying R code in order to take advantage of the packages developed in this language. MetaR is an integrated environment that makes it possible for users to write their own analyses with minimal knowledge of the syntax of the constructs. The auto-completion features of the projectional editors, in addition to the composition of elements from different languages, offer a convenient way to set references between objects and help users avoid typos.. A key aspect of MetaR is the way it combines the user interface and scripting in a single platform. This feature makes it possible to analyze data more efficiently. Experts can design simplified data analysis languages that do not require any prior programming experience and behave like graphical user interfaces while still maintaining the advantages of scripting. MetaR also makes it possible to perform analyses in native or virtualized environments.. The MetaR Languages. Since working with high-throughput data often requires using tables of data as inputs, MetaR includes Table as a key element of the design. Tables are imported into the MetaR models and then analyzed with metar-statements inside Analysis elements.. MetaR-statements are declarative language constructs that remove the need for prior knowledge of the language syntax, which helps provide a smooth learning curve for beginners just starting out, who have no knowledge of programming.. Example of Table imported in MetaR:. Example of Analysis script:. The Analysis script above shows how to import a table (import metar-statement), elaborate (limma voom — a popular method in statistical analysis to compare sets of genes) and transform (join, subset rows) its data, and finally draw (heatmap) and visualize/save (multiplot, render) a plot of the results, which is a very common set of procedures in data analysis.. This script uses only a very small subset of the metar-statements distributed with MetaR. However, the tool is general and can be readily extended to support a broad range of data analyses and visualizations. New languages can easily create and add new metar-statements that seamlessly integrate with those that already exist inside Analysis elements.. Other Examples of Data Visualization:. Target. MetaR can be used by:. Training Sessions. Training sessions are periodically offered to staff, students, postdocs, and investigators who hold an appointment in one of our Clinical & Translational Science Center institutions (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Hospital for Special Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Hunter College, and Cornell University), but they often include participants from other institutions in NYC. We have found that beginners can complete the assignments in session in less than 2 hours with MetaR, while more traditional training in R and its packages would require several sessions (6–24 hours) and an extensive technical background.. Why MPS. MetaR takes advantage of JetBrains MPS to make data analysis with the R language easier. MPS created brand new and unique possibilities for MetaR:. MetaR is distributed as a set of plugins for MPS.. References. Contacts. Manuele Simi, Senior Software Engineer, Weill Cornell Medicine. Twitter: @ManueleSimi. Similar Customer Stories. DTO.

What made you look for Space or alternative solutions?. Rather than using a multitude of individual tools, we’ve always preferred integrated environments. We started looking for a new digital home, and when we heard about Space at KotlinConf, we really liked the concept. So we decided to sign up.. Are there any alternative solutions you thought of opting for instead of Space?. Before signing up for Space, we had used Trello, Asana, and YouTrack, but none of them was “integrated” enough for us – we always needed a complementary tool (eg. to provide chats, wikis, message boards, etc.).. How was your collaboration process organised before? Which areas or steps of your process were missing/challenging/problematic? Were these problems related to changes in your business or company transformation (for example, rapid growth)?. We settled down in Basecamp, and enjoyed using it for quite some time. But as we progressed as a company, we found that it was evolving more slowly than we had expected and we started to feel like we had outgrown it.. In general, the areas of issue management, project hierarchy, and calendars are the most difficult to get right. In the tools we used, we almost always found these to be a bottleneck for productivity.. Why Space?. Why did your team decide to use Space?. We were looking for an integrated environment to be a new digital home for us that could seamlessly manage everything in one place. We learned about Space at KotlinConf 2019, and its concept resonated with us. Since we’re quite content with JetBrains tools, we decided to try Space as well. And we’ve been using it as our main tool ever since. Even though it was an EAP (now beta) with known issues and missing features, we adopted it, and we love using it in our daily lives.. What are the key benefits you get from using it?. The main benefits for us:. Feedback. Describe your experience during the adoption period: was it hard to get used to?. First, right after KotlinConf, the three of us did a closed test-run to evaluate Space. This went well, so we onboarded the team during an all-hands meeting where we went through all of Space’s features. We then did a test-run as a company, using Space and another product in parallel for about 1.5 months. Once we felt that we were reflexively using Space instead of the other product, we shut the latter down and started using Space exclusively.. Would you like to learn more about the features that Space is equipped with?. When it comes to Space’s educational material, the blog posts work great for us.

    "content": "What Developers Say About Us. I couldn't believe how easy it was. I installed the server and got my first project up-and-running in about 15 minutes... TeamCity is what TFS and CC.NET should be like when they grow up.. After becoming a real Resharper addict (can't use Visual Studio without it), I'm now becoming a slave to TeamCity as well. I've converted all my home projects, and life has never been better.. To me my value to a customer is providing the maximum productivity that I can and to me that productivity comes from using this tool.. The way I code works perfectly within the way R# aids me in being productive. It grants me a fluid motion to refactoring and code efficiency and helps me get into a groove when I code. A groove that is both productive and efficient and fun.. Without starting a flame war about which language is better, I just want to let all the VB.NET developers out there that read this to understand that this tool is THE bomb.. I can't imagine coding C#/TDD without it... If you haven't checked it out, it is worth it. It is the only tool in my arsenal that I was willing to use my own money. It will pay you back 100 fold..

Our team works with many different product and non-product teams. Each team has unique objectives and requirements, which call for a dedicated approach. Their goals can range from anything from driving traffic to their pages to increasing brand and product awareness. Our main goal is to help them meet their objectives so they can deliver important information to the relevant audience at the right place and at the right time and help our users find this information online.. In addition to expertise in digital marketing, our work requires a combination of various skills: a basic understanding of UX, web development and design, as well as the ability to react quickly and invent new solutions especially when it comes to “surprise” updates from platforms. And, of course, we need to be experts in web analytics and be able to configure analytics tools and interpret data.. “As Digital Marketers, we test various platforms and tools, searching for the best solutions that will help us deliver relevant messages to our tech-savvy audience at the right time. We work not only on creating product marketing campaigns but also with promoting cool and useful content created by our colleagues.”. Roman Prokhashev, Team Lead. “To build a strong digital marketing strategy, you need to research your audience in different ways. You need to be not only a marketer but also an analyst. Every day we solve interesting tasks on how to find an approach that reaches our users, and I can say that it is a special skill - not just to sell a product, but show how cool the product is so that people want to use and recommend it.”. Mariia Degtiareva, Digital Marketing Specialist. “Digital marketing is one of the most effective marketing tools. But, we are working with the IT audience, which has its own specific demands. When working with different ad channels, the key point for me is to understand how people will react to our promo activity, because the audience's attitude towards our advertising can influence further relationships with our brand.”. Kristina Kuznetsova, Digital Marketing Specialist. “Diversity of tasks, that’s what I love about my work. Today, I can be an analyst writing complex SQL queries; tomorrow, I will be a manager thinking over the concept and details of an advertising campaign; and the day after tomorrow, I’ll become an experimenter, launching new tests. I never get bored, because every day I can take on a different role.”. Anastasia Valieva, Digital Marketing Specialist. “For me, digital marketing is a captivating combination of processes that demand an understanding of not only how the internet works, but also of cognitive and behavioral psychology.

As a language, PHP offers non-trivial solutions to common problems, and we, at PhpStorm, strive to make the life of PHP developers easier. Each member of our team brings something important to the table – a new perspective, an idea, or a concern. At the same time, we often join our efforts and work together to solve issues.. “On our team, developers design new features, look for bugs, perform testing, and bring new ideas. Anyone can propose a change to any area, not necessarily the one they're directly responsible for.. We value what we're doing and concentrate both on our users' happiness and on exploring new challenging areas.”. Kirill Smelov, Software Developer. “Our developers not only write code, but communicate with the users directly, both in the issue tracker and in person. We commonly attend conferences to represent the company, give a talk, and collect some valuable feedback. Communication is key to creating a truly good product.”. Andrei Sokolov, Software Developer. “It's nice to be surrounded by people you can rely on. All of them care about the product and are always ready to discuss new ideas. A lot of cool features were born out of a casual coffee chat and then transformed into a valuable part of the product.”. Svetlana Zemlyanskaya, Software Developer. “An IDE is a very complex application that works with text, so the number of possible input data is indefinite. You have to be creative to understand what really matters for the end-users and where critical issues may occur. Besides, an IDE is almost a real-time application that should be very responsive to be comfortable to use, so performance is always our top priority. And performance testing is challenging if done right.”. Maxim Kolmakov, QA Engineer. “All team members care about the usability of new features and good user experience. The code that we write must be performant, effective, and well written.”. Artemy Pestretsov, Software Developer. Join the team.

Prague, Czech Republic, June 1, 2004 - JetBrains™, Inc., creators of intelligent application development tools, today announced it has launched its Early Access Program (EAP) for JetBrains ReSharper™, the company's powerful add-in tool for developers using Visual Studio.NET 2003. The ReSharper integrated plug-in enhances Visual Studio with powerful, intelligent C# code editing assistance and many of the same types of robust productivity enhancements they have come to rely on in the company's flagship IntelliJ IDEA IDE, now in version 4.0.. Strong, positive comments by initial trial users have already spread through the Internet's C# developer community newsgroups. Now JetBrains is expanding the EAP to invite C# developers everywhere to download the latest preview version. ReSharper makes its power available within Visual Studio VS.NET 2003 with a convenient, integrated ReSharper menu, without significant slowdown of Visual Studio. ReSharper is available for download at http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper.. \"Our early trial users have given us consistently great reports on ReSharper because it provides many of the same types of productivity enhancements in C# that IntelliJ IDEA provides in Java,\" said Eugene Belyaev, president and chief technology officer at JetBrains. \"By expanding the Early Adopter Program beyond our intellij.net online developer community, we now invite developers worldwide to help us make ReSharper an unmatched C# productivity tool in the Visual Studio environment.\".

    "content": "The Toolbox App team. Toolbox App is a small but very powerful app. It began as a Hackathon project back in 2015, developed in 2 days by a small group of passionate JetBrains developers with a big vision. Quite soon it became one of the most popular tools among JetBrains users. We see how its userbase grows every month and are excited to see that more than 750000 users are finding the tool useful these days.. Our team is distributed across Munich, Prague, and St.Petersburg. Our work includes product development, UI and UX, research, analytics, testing, and communicating with the users. We love that we bring value to our users and simplify their everyday developer processes.. At the Toolbox team, we believe that tools for development must be smart, fast, functional, and easy to deal with. That’s why we pay attention to every detail while developing the product.. “The Toolbox App is invisible most of the time and just does its job in the background, removing unnecessary distraction for hundreds of thousands of our users. But behind the scenes, we work hard to provide all the new tools, releases, and features in a timely manner. We collaborate intensively with all the other teams at JetBrains to ensure everything works as intended.”. Victor Kropp, Team Lead. “If the product saves time and efforts, and has a clear benefit, then its popularity will grow. I like that with the Toolbox App we help more than half a million developers.”. Konstantin Bulenkov, Project Coordinator. “I joined the Toolbox App team as an intern, and today I release new features to hundreds of thousands of users worldwide. It’s so exciting to receive cool feedback from the users on the features that you created.”. Anna Kuznetsova, Software Developer. “Being an IT-loving person, I realize how many technologies a software developer has to use nowadays. Toolbox App really helps JetBrains users to stay in touch with professional tools and products, so I’ve joined the Toolbox App team as a support engineer to help its users.”. Anna Kozhevnikova, Support Engineer. “The people in our team are supportive, smart, open-minded, and have lots of initiative. It’s very easy to be energetic and productive in such an atmosphere. I love working in the Toolbox App team and the freedom we have to create and implement our ideas and the shared belief to stay honest with our marketing.”. Marina Kovaleva, Product Marketing Manager. “Most of us at JetBrains had their owns scripts to download, unpack, and configure for a fresh IntelliJ IDEA or other IDE for daily use. I’ve stopped using my own script after we made Toolbox App”. Eugene Petrenko, Software Developer. Fancy joining our team?. At Toolbox, we have some ambitious projects in the works.

And we feel the same way about our users.. “I want RubyMine to prove that IDEs for dynamically typed languages can be so much more intelligent than they are today.”. Vladimir, software developer. From idea to production. In our small team, ideas don’t have to scrape through loads of approvals and never get lost in discussions. It takes few steps for a concept to get into production. While everyone in the team is given room for decision-making and enjoys responsibility, we listen to each other, and cross-review is essential to our work. It helps us overcome failures, learn, and grow as a team.. Playing in hard mode. The intricacies of Ruby make our job both challenging and exciting. We face tasks which have never been tackled before. We invent and implement new approaches to dynamic language analysis and believe that a good IDE can neutralise any quirk of the language.. “When I talk to our users, I feel that these people are different. It has a ground: those who write in a particular language have a certain set of mind. As a support engineer, I judge by the users. And our users are awesome!”. Olga, support engineer.
